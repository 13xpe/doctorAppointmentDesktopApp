<strong>Doctor Appointment App is a simple application where medical staff, like doctors and nurses, are able to check/manage/add/delete patients in a specific database. More than this, the medical staff
can also check/manage/add or delete appointments related to a specific doctor.</strong>

The app starts with a login where every doctor will have a username and password to login into their accounts. If a doctor or nurse has no account yet, they can click on "Create an account" and the information will be stored allowing the medical staff to login right away with their credentials.
